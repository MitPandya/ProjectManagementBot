## Bot

In this Milestone we have implemented a bot based on our proposed design and use cases. We have used Slack as our bot interaction platform, Node.js as our backend server, PostGre database for persistence, BotKit.js for bot interactions module, Nock along with json for mocking REST APIs and Selenium for testing the end to end use case. Below we will describe every component implemented in this milestone in details.
