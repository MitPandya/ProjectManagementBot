### Problems Solved

Promanbot is designed to solve many Project Management related issues when it comes to using the Trello Board as it has a lot of limitations on the features related to effective Agile Software Development Process. Promanbot dealth with solving three major issues as follows:
* Trello Card Interactions e.g. Add, Mark, Remove, and listing Checklist/Todo Items of the card
* Sending Real-Time Notifications to all the Members of a Card
* Generating a Weekly Summary of all the Card's Status (Complete and Pending)

### Primary Features
The bot initializes by asking the first time user to do their Trello account's setup. After the Trello account is setup, the bot shows the main menu, which provides three options to the user.
