## Problem Statement
Successful and timely development of projects requires lots of complications and manual work involved in identifying tasks and assigning them to appropriate person. The project manger are also responsible for certain trivial responsibilities such as scheduling test/release date and making sure all the tasks are completed before deadlines. Developer and testers are expected to keep of track of task schedules and it often results in them using some simple kind of tools such as sticky notes.

All the above problems pose one or more problems since humans are prone to errors. The develoment team might be struck on a task and manager might not be aware of such problems. Miscommunications can cause significant delays in project release and could have been avoided with a simple automation.
